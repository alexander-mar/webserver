# webserver : university assignment (dont plagarise)

You are tasked with building a web server that will handle multiple connections and execute applications that are compliant with a subset
of the Common Gateway Interface specification. The Common Gateway Interface is used by web-servers to allow compatible programs to be
executed on the server, to process HTTP requests and compute a HTTP response. The web-server uses standard input and output as well as
environment variables for communication between the CGI program and the itself. HTTP requests that are received by the web-server can be
passed to a CGI program via shell environment variables and standard input.
